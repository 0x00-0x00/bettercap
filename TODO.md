- [x] Replace PacketFu::Utils::whoami? with something else.
- [x] Capture to .pcap file.
- [x] BPF filters.
- [x] BeEF proxy module ( [BeefBOX](https://github.com/evilsocket/bettercap-proxy-modules/blob/master/beefbox.rb) ).
- [ ] Use raw file arp parsing instead of "arp -a" to improve speed.
- [ ] ICMP Redirect.
- [ ] sslstrip
- [ ] sslmitm
- [ ] *BSD Support.
- [ ] HTTP/2 Support.
- [ ] Active packet filtering/injection/etc.

**Maybe**

- [ ] Replace webrick with thin ( proxy too? )
- [ ] DNS Spoofing ( not sure if it actually makes any sense ).
- [ ] Windows Support? ( OMG PLZ NO! )
- [ ] Output/actions as json for UI integration?
- [ ] BeefBox / BeefDRONE with Raspberry PI?
